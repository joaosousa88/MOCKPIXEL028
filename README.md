## Project Description

This is a concept app that is a playground for the provided car endpoints from the API, that:

* Manages expenditure and changes status
* Knows the current location


## How to build and run the project.

To build the app please open a terminal window and run the following commands:

```
git clone ...
cd ..
npm i
node server.js
```

Then, in a new terminal, go to the project directory and run

```npm start```

Finally, go to `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser.

## Improvements and other ideas

This is the story of Patrick, father of two.
Because of his love for nature and the mountains, he went to live in the hills of Zürich. In the winter it is very cold but thanks to his Mercedes App he can schedule the car temperature and engine start. This way, he may start his journey as soon as he gets in the car.

Since the roads are frozen, other Mercedes are activating their ESP, and Patrick receives a notification to be cautious in the roads ahead.

This time, he is not going to work — he is going to Disneyland with the family. Because he planned the trip, the car notified that his brake pads should be swapped, suggesting the nearest Mercedes shops to instantly book an appointment. While he was at it, the app also reminded him that his wife's car was due for a maintenance soon too, so he also booked that.


Far into his journey and tired of driving, he changed seats with his oldest son, changing the active profile in the car. Since he is taller than dad, the seats lower and the mirrors adjust suit his preferences. Because he has a bit of a lead foot, the father activates a speed limiter, as well as longer intervals on the warnings for resting.

Arriving at the destination, they are in such a hurry that the youngest kid left the back window open. As they moved away from the car, they get a notification, asking if they want to close the window.

Since this was not their lucky day, after half an hour Patrick gets a notification that there was a hit on the rear of the car with a photo caught at the time with the car camera.

Worried with the car, the oldest sun goes and checks the car, realising it was nothing too serious. He then parks the car in a safer place, but with everything he forgets to put on the seatbelt. Dad immediately gets a notification that the car is being driven without minimum security by the son's profile.

At the end of the day, tired of all the fun, the sun loses control of the car, but it's ok, because Mercedes knows everything about the car, like where it is, what it needs and who is driving it.


## Feedback

The opportunity given to the attendees to play with a car API does not come by every day, it was a lot of fun, and the team was also very helpful and interested in talking to us to bounce off ideas and show us more about the software solutions and roadmap for the brand.
Our dislike was not being able to bring home the car that was next to the Smart.
